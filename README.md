## üè¢ System Architecture

The **Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform** is architected following the **Clean Architecture** paradigm, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

### Architecture Layers

1. **Presentation Layer (WebAPI)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Handle HTTP requests and responses.
     - Implement controllers and API endpoints.
     - Utilize Swagger for interactive API documentation.
   - **Technologies**:
     - ASP.NET Core 8.0
     - Swagger/OpenAPI

2. **Application Layer**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Contains business logic using the **CQRS** pattern with **MediatR**.
     - Defines commands, queries, and handlers.
     - Implements DTOs and validation using **FluentValidation**.
   - **Technologies**:
     - MediatR
     - FluentValidation
     - AutoMapper

3. **Domain Layer (Core)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Defines domain entities, value objects, enums, and interfaces.
     - Contains business rules and domain logic.
   - **Technologies**:
     - Custom domain models

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Implements data access using **Entity Framework Core**.
     - Manages external services like email sending with **MailKit**.
     - Handles authentication and authorization.
     - Configures dependency injection and logging with **Serilog**.
   - **Technologies**:
     - Entity Framework Core
     - Serilog
     - MailKit

```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Client** sends an HTTP request to the **WebAPI**.
2. **WebAPI Controller** receives the request and delegates it to the **Application Layer** using **MediatR**.
3. **Application Layer** processes the command/query, interacting with the **Domain Layer** as needed.
4. **Domain Layer** enforces business rules and interacts with the **Infrastructure Layer** for data access.
5. **Infrastructure Layer** communicates with the database or external services.
6. The response flows back through the layers to the **Client**.

### Relationships and Constraints

- **Users & Roles**: Many-to-Many via `UserRoles` table.
- **Users & Bookings**: One-to-Many (A user can have multiple bookings).
- **Users & Reviews**: One-to-Many (A user can write multiple reviews).
- **Hotels & Owners**: Many-to-One (A hotel has one owner; an owner can own multiple hotels).
- **Hotels & Cities**: Many-to-One (A hotel belongs to one city; a city can have multiple hotels).
- **Hotels & RoomClasses**: One-to-Many (A hotel can have multiple room classes).
- **RoomClasses & Rooms**: One-to-Many (A room class can have multiple rooms).
- **RoomClasses & Discounts**: One-to-Many (A room class can have multiple discounts).
- **Bookings & Rooms**: Many-to-Many via `InvoiceDetails` table.
- **Hotels & Reviews**: One-to-Many (A hotel can have multiple reviews).
- **Images**: Polymorphic association via `EntityId` and `Type` to various entities (e.g., Hotels, Cities).

### Notes

- **Enum Representations**: Enums like `PaymentType`, `ImageType`, `HotelStatus`, and `RoomType` are stored as integers in the database.
- **Auditable Entities**: Entities implementing `IAuditableEntity` include `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` fields to track creation and modification times.
